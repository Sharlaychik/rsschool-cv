### Briefly About Myself #
_I am 37 years old. I have always liked programming, robotics, radio electronics. I got acquainted with Arduino and unlimited possibilities through programming. Now I decided to completely plunge into the world of programming and automation. Decided to start with Front End. And in the future I will study Beck End, for a complete understanding of all the details of the automation process. I studied everything on my own and realized that I finally found what I like to do all the time._

_I can't wait to apply my knowledge to real projects and start a career in this field._

### Code example:
**KATA from CODEWARS:** Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

```
function validParentheses(parens) {
  let answ = true
  let reg = /\(\)/g
  
  while (parens.search(reg) !== -1){
    parens = parens.replace(reg,"")
  }
  
  if (parens.length >= 1)
  answ = false
    
  return answ
}
```
