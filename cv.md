### Briefly About Myself #
_I am 37 years old. I have always liked programming, robotics, radio electronics. I got acquainted with Arduino and unlimited possibilities through programming. Now I decided to completely plunge into the world of programming and automation. Decided to start with Front End. And in the future I will study Beck End, for a complete understanding of all the details of the automation process. I studied everything on my own and realized that I finally found what I like to do all the time._

_I can't wait to apply my knowledge to real projects and start a career in this field._
